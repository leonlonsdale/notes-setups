# notes-setups
Notes for setups for operating systems, servers, utilities, and tools



This is a WIP. I've recently switched from, MacOS & Windows to Linux using CachyOS. I suppose the better terming would be that I've ADDED CachyOS, since I do still use Windows and MacOS for other things.
This repo is simply a brain dump of the things I do to configure it the way I like it so that if (I pray never) I ever have to re-install, I can get back productivity faster.
